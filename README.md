# Rock Paper Scissors Game

Simple solidity game where 2 players can play at a time. 

- each player will have to commit a choice with a secret number, and pay a fee (0.01 ETH/MATIC/OTHER NATIVE EVM COIN)
- once both players have committed their choice, they will then have to reveal their choice
- the winner gets a reward (0.015 ETH/MATIC/OTHER NATIVE EVM COIN)

TODO:
- web interface
    - you can play on remix by copying the contract
    - or, you can go to polygon testnet (mumbai) and play there
